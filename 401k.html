<p>A 401K is a retirement savings plan that is sponsored by your employer. It&#39;s a way for you to save money for retirement, usually with a bit of monetary help from your company. Companies aren&#39;t required to offer their employees a 401K; it&#39;s a benefit and incentive that a company can provide to make itself more competitive and attractive to potential employees. There are some great advantages to contributing to a 401K, as well as a few rules governing how you can use them.</p>
<p>401K plans are named for the section of the Internal Revenue Code where they&#39;re defined. They officially came into being in 1978 and became popular in the 1980s as a way to supplement and then eventually replace pension plans. Certain aspects of 401Ks are government-mandated, such as contribution maximums, while certain others are decided on by your employer.</p>
<p>So why have a 401K? Why not just hide all your cash under your mattress and live off that when you retire? There are a few good reasons:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Money placed in a 401K can be invested. How you invest it is entirely up to you, not your employer, so it does require some effort and thought from you (although if you don&#39;t like effort or thought where investing is concerned, there are certain funds designed for people like you, where you just choose the year you expect to retire and your investments will be balanced for you as the years go by). But you can potentially have a lot more money in your account by the time you hit retirement age than you would have had under your mattress.</li>
   <li>Many employers do something called matching for 401Ks. We&#39;ll talk more about it later, but we&#39;re letting you know now that you should be excited.</li>
</ul>

               <h2>​401Ks at Wavetronix</h2>
               <hr/>
               <p>Wavetronix provides 401Ks through Fidelity Investments; you can view your account at 401k.com. You can also use information on that website to contact Fidelity with additional questions, if you have them.</p>
               <div class="spacer">&#160;</div>
               <h2>Contributions</h2>
               <hr/>​ 
               <p>At Wavetronix, you are eligible to start a 401K after you have been working here for 90 calendar days; you set it up with HR and accounting and that money is automatically deducted from your paycheck and you don&#39;t have to remember to mail a check or drive to the bank or anything. This is a fairly common way for 401Ks to be set up. Some companies enroll all their employees in the company 401K automatically, and anyone who doesn&#39;t want to be part of it has to opt out; Wavetronix, however, is one of the companies that require you to opt in. You can opt in as soon as you become eligible after being hired.</p>
               <p>(As a side note, you may not stay at the same company forever; if you have a 401K at one company and you go to a different company, you can roll that money over to your new company&#39;s 401K or to an IRA. Rolling over from another account is one way to put money in a 401K, but there are rules about how to do it, so do your research.)</p>
               <p>There are two types of 401K plans; each company&#39;s plan may allow you to choose one or the other or both of the following types.</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Traditional – When you have a traditional plan, you put money into the account pre-taxation. Let&#39;s say you made $100,000 last year and you put 5% of that, or $5,000, into a traditional 401K. That means that you will only pay taxes on $95,000 for the year. Don&#39;t get too excited, though; those taxes are going to catch up with you eventually. Specifically, you will have to pay those taxes when you withdraw the money from the account, when you retire.</li>
                  <li>Roth – With Roth plans, you put money into the account post-taxation. With the example above, that means you&#39;ll pay taxes on the full $100,000, but when you withdraw money from the account, you won&#39;t pay any taxes on it.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>(As a side note: there&#39;s another sort of popular retirement savings plan, called an individual retirement account or IRA. As you might guess from the name, these are started and managed entirely by you. They can also be either traditional or Roth.)</p>
               <p>The 401K plan at Wavetronix allows you to choose either traditional or Roth, or both. </p>
               <p>As mentioned above, certain elements of the 401K are decided by the government; they will be the same no matter who your employer is. This includes the maximum limit on total yearly employee contributions: $17,500 for 2013-2014. If you&#39;re 50 years old or older at any point during this year, however, you&#39;re allowed catch-up contributions; you can put an extra $5,500 for 2014. This limit only includes the amount of money you put into the account, not any money that your employer puts in. Why would your employer be putting money into your 401K? Let&#39;s talk about that.</p>
               <div class="spacer">&#160;</div>
               <h2>Matching and Vesting</h2>
               <hr/>
               <p>Many employers do something called matching that is pretty darned great. What it means is that for every dollar you put into your 401K, your employer will also put in a dollar—up to a certain amount. The average amount of matching that employers in the US do is 3% of your paycheck, but—lucky you—you work at Wavetronix, which matches 5%.</p>
               <p>To say it a little more precisely, the company matches your contributions $1.00 on the dollar up to 5% of your gross income. To say it a little less precisely, you save a dollar, Wavetronix saves a dollar for you (up to 5%; if you contribute more than that, good for you but the company will still only pay the 5%). Just like that. It is basically free money. So if you make $100,000 a year, and you put in 5% of that—$5,000—Wavetronix will also put in $5,000 and suddenly you have twice as much money in that account. However, if you put in 7%, or $7,000, you still only get $5,000 from the company.</p>
               <p>To restate for emphasis, in case you weren&#39;t listening the first time, that is free money that the company wants to give you as a sort of financial high five for having the good sense to save for retirement. We&#39;re not here to tell you how to live your life, but for this we might make an exception and say you should really take advantage of this. Because come on, free money.</p>
               <p>And that money is all yours. Different companies have different ways of dealing with their matching contributions should you quit or be fired; this is called vesting. Specifically, vesting is the process by which you are given the right to take the company&#39;s matching contributions with you when you go. You can always take 100% of your own contributions with you, but for the money that the company contributes, each plan has different rules. Three of the most common are below:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>If you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;re fully vested as soon as you start your 401K. This means that even if you quit your job a month after starting your 401K, you get to take all of your company&#39;s contributions with you.</li>
                  <li>With cliff vesting, the company sets an amount of time, usually a few years; if you leave the company before that time, you forfeit all of your employer&#39;s contributions, and if you leave after that time, you are fully vested and you get to keep all the contributions.</li>
                  <li>With graded vesting, you get to keep a certain percentage of the employer contributions if you leave, and that percentage goes up with each year that passes—for example, you keep 10% of it if you leave after one year, but 25% if you leave after two, and so on. So if you plan on quitting your job to fulfill your lifelong dream of driving an ice cream van, find out when you&#39;re fully vested at your company and plan your exit accordingly.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>At Wavetronix—you guessed it—it&#39;s the first bullet point. You are fully vested from the moment you start a 401K.</p>
               <div class="spacer">&#160;</div>
               <h2>Withdrawing from a 401K</h2>
               <hr/>
               <p>So you have a 401K, you&#39;ve put money into it, you&#39;ve invested it, but what do you do when you need that money?</p>
               <p>401Ks are meant as retirement funds, so the easiest way to withdraw is when you have retired. You can&#39;t take that money out free and clear until you&#39;re 59 ½ years old—or, if you retire early, you can start accessing the money at 55. At that point, you&#39;ll just pay taxes on the money, if you had a traditional 401K. And then you can use the money to fund your retirement dreams of going to every national park in the US in an RV.</p>
               <p>When you retire, you can take out all the money at once, or a little bit at a time. Be aware, though, of RMDs: required minimum distributions. Once you reach age 70 ½, you must withdraw a certain amount of money every year. The amount you have to withdraw is determined by a slightly complicated formula; check the IRS website if you want details.</p>
               <p>But what if you really, really need the money in that account and you&#39;re not 59 ½? Don&#39;t lose hope! There are options. We&#39;ll cover them in the next two sections.</p>
               <div class="spacer">&#160;</div>
               <h2>401K Loans</h2>
               <hr/>
               <p>First option for getting money out early: take out a loan from your 401K. We mention this because it&#39;s possible, not because we necessarily recommend it. You&#39;ll hear some people who support taking out loans on 401Ks—under certain extreme circumstances—because sometimes you get a better rate of interest than you would at a bank. However, taking out a loan can be a bad idea for the following reasons:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>That&#39;s money that is no longer earning interest, so even though you&#39;re going to pay it back, you&#39;re probably going to have less money when you retire.</li>
                  <li>On top of that, some plans don&#39;t allow you to contribute to the 401K while you still have an outstanding loan, so you will continue to have less money and therefore less interest earned for at least part of the duration of the loan.</li>
                  <li>Even though it&#39;s really your own money you&#39;re borrowing, you still have to pay interest.</li>
                  <li>You have to pay them off within a set amount of time, usually five years (longer if you took out the loan in order to buy a house); fail to pay off the loan within the allotted time, and the loan stops being a loan and starts being a regular withdrawal, meaning you pay the income tax plus the penalty for withdrawing before 59 ½ (which is generally 10%).</li>
                  <li>You have to make payments post-tax. This doesn&#39;t really affect the principal on the loan (the amount you pay to cover what you borrowed in the first place), but the interest you pay on the loan is going to be taxed twice: once before the payment, and once when you withdraw at retirement.</li>
                  <li>If you quit or are fired while you still have a loan, you&#39;ll generally have to repay the balance within a fairly short amount of time. If you don&#39;t—yep, 10% again.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>But all this aside, in certain dire circumstances you may need to take a loan out. Just be aware of the downfalls and make sure that you&#39;ve exhausted your other options first.</p>
               <p>The Wavetronix 401K plan allows loans; here&#39;s what you need to know about them.</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>You can apply for one loan per calendar year, and you may only have one loan at any given time.</li>
                  <li>You&#39;ll be charged a $175 setup fee for each new loan that is processed.</li>
                  <li>The interest you&#39;ll be charged for the loan will be a fixed amount for the duration of the loan; the amount is determined by the plan administrator.</li>
                  <li>The minimum loan amount is $1,000, and the maximum is whichever is less: half your account balance or $50,000, unless you&#39;ve had another loan out in the last twelve months, in which case it&#39;s $50,000 minus the highest outstanding loan balance you&#39;ve had over those twelve months.</li>
                  <li>Payments on the loan are deducted through payroll each pay period.</li>
                  <li>If you default on the loan, or if you leave the company or die, the entire remaining amount must be paid off immediately.</li>
               </ul>
               <div class="spacer">&#160;</div>
               <h2>Hardship Withdrawals</h2>
               <hr/>
               <p>There&#39;s a second way to get that money out early, but only under very specific circumstances and you&#39;re going to be penalized for doing so. Most—but not all—plans allow for something called a hardship withdrawal. This means that if you find yourself in immediate and heavy financial need, and you genuinely have no other way to pay it, you may withdraw the money early. The IRS allows hardship withdrawals under the following circumstances:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Medical expenses</li>
                  <li>Buying a home</li>
                  <li>College tuition (for you, a spouse, or a dependent)</li>
                  <li>Paying to avoid being evicted from your home</li>
                  <li>Funeral expenses (for you, a spouse, or a dependent)</li>
                  <li>Expenses to repair your home, under certain circumstances</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Wavetronix allows hardship withdrawals but only when you&#39;ve exhausted all other assets. &quot;All other assets&quot; includes the loans we talked about above, so you can only withdraw this way if you did the loan thing but you still need more money. You should also be aware of the following:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Hardship withdrawals must be approved by the plan administrator, and they must be requested for the same reasons we mentioned in the list above.</li>
                  <li>If you&#39;re doing this kind of withdrawal, you can only withdraw funds that you put in there, not interest or company matching contributions.</li>
                  <li>For the first six months after you receive this withdrawal, you can&#39;t put any more into the 401K—only your repayments.</li>
                  <li>The minimum you can withdraw is $500.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>But this is definitely not what a 401K is for—you really don&#39;t want to mess up your retirement later for something you want now—so to discourage you, the IRS charges an excise tax of 10%. That means you&#39;ll pay the IRS 10% of the amount you withdraw, plus the income tax (if you did the traditional plan). That&#39;s a lot of money, which should worry you.</p>
               <p>Basically, don&#39;t do this unless you really can&#39;t avoid it.​</p>
