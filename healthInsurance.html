</p>
<p>Health insurance is insurance that covers part or all of your medical and surgical expenses. This can vary from simple doctor&#39;s checkups to major medical events and hospital stays. It also can include tests, lab work, CAT scans, and the like, as well as prescription drugs and mental/behavioral health needs.​</p>
<p>It generally does not cover cosmetic procedures, experimental treatments, and procedures that are not medically necessary.</p>
<p>Be aware that some services must be pre-authorized—that is, your insurance provider must decide that a procedure or service is medically necessary before it is performed—or they won&#39;t cover it.​​</p>

               <p>
               </p>
               <p>Wavetronix provides health insurance to active full-time employees through Select Health and Meritain Health. For new employees, you are eligible for this insurance on the first of the month after 30 days&#160;of employment. So if you started on June 15, you&#39;d be eligible on August 1.</p>
               <p>To have this insurance, you need to opt in during open enrollment, which happens toward the end of each calendar year. Additionally, you can make changes to your insurance at the time of a major life event, such as marriage or the birth of a child.</p>
               <p>There are three different plans you can choose from:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Employees living in Utah County will likely want to choose Select Med Plus, available through Select Health, as it is primarily used for Utah County providers.</li>
                  <li>Employees living in Utah but outside Utah County will likely want to choose Select Care Plus, also available through Select Health, as it is used for providers statewide.</li>
                  <li>Employees living outside Utah will get their health insurance through Meritain Health.</li>
               </ul>

               <p>The following section will discuss the Select Med Plus and Select Care Plus plans available through Select Health. Information on Meritain Health will be covered later.</p>
               <h3>Premiums</h3>
               <p>
               </p>
               <p>
               </p>
               <p>The cost of this insurance to you (called a premium) is automatically taken out of your paycheck every pay period. The rest of the cost of the insurance is covered by Wavetronix. The premium you pay varies based on the plan you have selected.</p>
               <p>The premiums for Select Med Plus are as follows:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <span style="line-height: 1.6;">$3</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">6.37 for single plans. This plan is most commonly chosen by unmarried employees with no dependents. You could also elect to use it if you&#39;re married but your spouse is already covered by his or her company&#39;s insurance.​</span><br/></li>
                  <li>
                     <span style="line-height: 1.6;">$76.38 for two-party plans. You might elect to use this plan if you are married with no dependents and you want your spouse covered by your insurance. You might also choose this plan if you have one dependent and no spouse (or your spouse doesn&#39;t need to be covered).</span><br/></li>
                  <li>
                     <span style="line-height: 1.6;">$112.76 for family plans. Choose this plan if you need to have two or more additional people (spouse and/or dependen</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">ts) covered.</span><br/></li>
               </ul>
               <p>The premiums for Select Care Plus are as follows:</p>
               <ul>

               <p>
               </p>
               <h3>Provider Network</h3>
               <p>
               </p>
               <p>The amount that the insurance provider will cover varies based on which medical care provider you visit.</p>
               <p>The insurance provider has agreements with certain medical care providers; they have negotiated certain rates for certain services. All the medical providers with whom this agreement has been reached are referred to as a provider network. Also, often the in-network providers are called &quot;participating&quot; and the out-of-network providers are called &quot;non-participating.&quot; To get the insurance provider to cover as much of your costs as possible, it&#39;s wise to choose participating providers. You can find participating medical care providers in your area by visiting intermountainhealthcare.org/providers. But what if you can&#39;t find a participating medical care provider you like, or you have a medical emergency while traveling? In this case, you can go to a non-participating provider. Be aware of three things: first, the insurance provider generally covers less—sometimes a lot less—of the cost than they would have for a participating provider. Second, the amount the insurance provider will pay for a given service is based on something called the allowed amount. If you get a service done by an out-of-network provider and they charge more than the allowed amount, you may have to pay the difference. Third, your deductible is higher if you use non-participating providers.​</p>
               <h3>Deductible​​</h3>
               <p>
               </p>
               <p>While we&#39;re on the subject of deductibles, let&#39;s talk about those. A deductible is the amount of money you have to pay out of your own pocket (or your HSA) before the insurance kicks in. At Wavetronix, the deductible for a single plan is $1,500 and the deductible for a family or two-party plan is $3,000. However, this deductible only has to be paid once a year. This means that if you&#39;re on the single plan, and in March you have a hospital stay that costs $2,000, you have to pay the first $1,500. Then insurance kicks in and pays 80% of the rest of the hospital stay (80% of $500 is $400). Then you pay the last $100. However, if you need prescription drugs in June, you don&#39;t have to pay any of that as the deductible; it&#39;s already been paid for this year. You just pay the amount that&#39;s left after the insurance company has covered its share. If you have a baby next January, though, the deductible will have reset and you&#39;re going to have to pay it all over again. But you&#39;ll have a baby at that point, so that&#39;s cool.</p>
               <p>While we&#39;re on the topic of you paying money, let&#39;s talk about the out-of-pocket limit. This is the maximum amount of money that you will have to pay in a given year for insurance out of your own pocket. For singletons, this amount is $2,500; for those on the two-party or family plans, that amount is $5,000. So what does that mean to you? Let&#39;s go back to our example in the previous paragraph. You paid $1,600 for your first hospital stay ($1,500 deductible + the 20% that the insurance didn&#39;t cover). Let&#39;s say that instead of needing prescription drugs in June, what you actually needed was a new liver, and that is going to cost you $300,000. 20% of $300,000 is $60,000, which is an amount of money that would make some people panic. But not you! You&#39;ve got insurance. The difference between the $2,500 limit and the amount you&#39;ve already paid is $900. You pay that and the insurance provider will pay 100% of the rest (well, of the allowed amount, anyway). You sure dodged that bullet.</p>
               <p>There are some caveats, though; certain things don&#39;t count toward your out-of-pocket limit. These include premiums (the amount you pay for the privilege of having insurance), balance-billed charges (the amount you pay if you used a non-participating provider and they charged more than the allowed amount), healthcare this plan doesn&#39;t cover, and penalties for failure to obtain pre-authorization for services.</p>
               <p>There&#39;s also good news, though: the HSA that all Wavetronix employees are on is designed to cover this amount—that is, if things work out as planned, you should have enough money in your HSA to cover these out-of-pocket expenses. This only works if your HSA is fully funded; if you&#39;re new and haven&#39;t put away much money yet, or if you&#39;ve had to use your HSA for dental work, for example, this won&#39;t work as well. Still, that is nothing to sneeze at.</p>
               <p>(If you have medical expenses and your HSA is not yet fully funded, health care providers are often amenable to letting you work out a payment plan for your medical expenses. In that case, you could pay the bill off in increments every time money gets put into your HSA.)</p>
               <h3>Coverage</h3>
               <p>
               </p>
               <p>As we get into the coverage section, let&#39;s cover a few points to be aware of: first, if you are on the family plan, the coverage listed below covers your dependents until they turn 26. Second, there is no pre-existing condition limitation. This means that if you&#39;ve already been diagnosed with chronic hiccups and you&#39;re going to need a lot of medical expenses paid, the insurance provider can&#39;t refuse to cover you because of it; you&#39;re set insurance-wise. So now you only have the hiccups to worry about.</p>
               <p>Now the big question: what is covered and for how much? That info is all in that table we saw earlier, but here&#39;s a breakdown of that info with some explanations.</p>
               <p>Standard immunizations and minor diagnostic testing are covered 100%. You pay 20% of elective immunizations—any immunization that doesn&#39;t fall under the &quot;standard&quot; heading. (FYI, that 20% you pay is called &quot;co-insurance.&quot;)</p>
               <p>Preventive care works a little differently. Preventive care is any routine medical checkup, meant to prevent and detect disease before it gets serious rather than being meant to treat a disease that&#39;s already happening. With preventive care, the amount you pay varies based on whether it&#39;s a primary care provider (PCP) or a secondary care provider (SCP). A PCP is a general practitioner—your family doctor, essentially. An SCP is a specialist, such as a dermatologist.</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <span style="line-height: 1.6;">For a PCP, there&#39;s a $15 co-pay.</span></li>
                  <li>
                     <span style="line-height: 1.6;"></span> 
                     <span style="line-height: 1.6;">For an SCP, there&#39;s a $25 co-pay.</span></li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                  <span style="line-height: 1.6;"></span></p>
               <p>So what&#39;s a co-pay? A co-pay is a set amount of money that you pay for a visit or service, usually at the time it occurs. You pay that amount up front, and then they will bill later for the rest. If you haven&#39;t yet reached your deductible, you pay the rest of that bill. If you have reached the deductible, the insurance provider pays the rest of that bill.</p>
               <p>For everything else on our list, all the amounts given are AD (after deductible). Remember our deductibles? $1,500 for single plans and $3,000 for family and two-party plans? Well, until you&#39;ve reached that deductible, you cover 100% of everything in the list below. Once you&#39;ve paid that $1,500 or $3,000 out of your own pocket, the following coverages kick in:</p>
               <p>
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>For office visits and minor office surgeries, you pay $15 after deductible (AD) for a PCP and $25 AD for an SCP.</li>
                  <li>Urgent care depends on where you visit: if you go to Intermountain InstaCare/Urgent Care, you pay $35 AD, and if you go to Intermountain KidsCare (SL Valley &amp; North), you pay $15 AD.</li>
                  <li>If you go to the emergency room, you pay $75 AD.</li>
                  <li>What you pay for prescriptions varies based on two things: how big a supply you get (your standard 30-day supply, or a larger 90-day supply that must be ordered via mail) and also the type of drugs you get. Prescription drugs fall into three tiers, which is why there&#39;s three prices under each of the bullets below. To find out which tier a needed drug falls into, visit selecthealth.org.</li>
                  <ul>
                     <li>For a 30-day supply, you pay $7 or $21 or $42 AD (depending on tier)</li>
                     <li>For a mail order 90-day supply, you pay $7 or $42 or $126 AD (depending on tier)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>You pay 20% AD for the following: major diagnostic testing, hospital costs (including physician fees, ambulances, and hospital rooms), surgery, maternity (including prenatal and postnatal care as well as delivery and inpatient services), and durable medical equipment (this is equipment and supplies ordered by a care provider, such as wheelchairs, oxygen equipment, etc.).</li>
                  <li>For mental health and substance abuse disorder office visits, you pay $15 AD; for other inpatient and outpatient services, you pay 20% AD.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>
               </p>
               <p>
               </p>
               <p>
               </p>
               <p>Remember that all the numbers given above are only true if you&#39;re going to an in-network provider. Out-of-network providers are generally not covered as much.</p>
               <p>For your information, the following services require pre-authorization from the insurance provider:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Inpatient services</li>
                  <li>Maternity stays longer than two days for a normal delivery or longer than four days for a cesarean</li>
                  <li>Certain durable medical equipment</li>
                  <li>Home healthcare, hospice, and private duty nursing services</li>
                  <li>All services obtained outside of the United States unless a routine, urgent, or emergency condition</li>
                  <li>Pain management/pain clinic services</li>
                  <li>Certain injectable drugs and specialty medications; selected prescription drugs</li>
                  <li>Cochlear implants and organ transplants</li>
               </ul>
               <p>

               <h2>Meritain Health</h2>
               <hr/>
               <p>Now we&#39;ll look at Meritain Health, which is the health insurance for employees living in states other than Utah.</p>
               <h3>Premiums</h3>
               <p>
               </p>
               <p>
               </p>
               <p>The cost of this insurance to you (called a premium) is automatically taken out of your paycheck every pay period. The rest of the cost of the insurance is covered by Wavetronix. The premium you pay varies based on the plan you have elected.</p>
               <p>The premiums for the Meritain Nation Care HealthSave plan are as follows:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>$39.44 for single plans. This plan is most commonly chosen by unmarried employees with no dependents (children under 26; those older than 26 are no longer eligible to be covered), but you could also elect to use it if you&#39;re married but your spouse is already covered by his or her company&#39;s insurance.</li>
                  <li>$82.81 for two-party plans. You might elect to use this plan if you are married with no dependents and you want your spouse covered by your insurance. You might also choose this plan if you have one dependent and no spouse (or your spouse doesn&#39;t need to be covered).</li>
                  <li>$122.25 for family plans. Choose this plan if you need to have two or more people (spouse and/or dependents) covered.​</li>
               </ul>
               <p>
               </p>
               <h3>Provider Network</h3>
               <p>
               </p>
               <p>The amount that the insurance provider will cover varies based on which medical care provider you visit.</p>
               <p>The insurance provider has agreements with certain medical care providers; they have negotiated certain rates for certain services. All the medical providers with whom this agreement has been reached are referred to as a provider network. Also, often the in-network providers are called &quot;participating&quot; and the out-of-network providers are called &quot;non-participating.&quot; To get the insurance provider to cover as much of your costs as possible, it&#39;s wise to choose participating providers.</p>
               <p>Where you go to find participating providers varies based on what state you live in:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>If you live in Idaho, you use the Idaho Physicians Network and can find a provider at www.ipnmd.com/ipn.</li>
                  <li>If you live in Florida, you use First Health and can find a provider at www.firsthealth.coventryhealthcare.com.</li>
                  <li>If you live in Georgia, you use Aetna and can find a provider at www.aetna.com/docfind.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>But what if you can&#39;t find a participating medical care provider you like, or you have a medical emergency while traveling? In this case, you can go to a non-participating provider. Be aware of three things: first, the insurance provider generally covers less—sometimes a lot less—of the cost than they would have for a participating provider. Second, the amount the insurance provider will pay for a given service is based on something called the allowed amount. If you get a service done by an out-of-network provider and they charge more than the allowed amount, you may have to pay the difference. Third, your deductible is higher if you use non-participating providers.</p>
               <h3>Deductible</h3>
               <p>
               </p>
               <p>While we&#39;re on the subject of deductibles, let&#39;s talk about those. A deductible is the amount of money you have to pay out of your own pocket (or your HSA) before the insurance kicks in. At Wavetronix, the deductible for a single plan is $1,500 and the deductible for a family or two-party plan is $3,000. However, this deductible only has to be paid once a year. This means that if you&#39;re on the family plan, and in April you have to get your appendix removed and it costs $8,000, you have to pay the first $3,000. Then insurance kicks in and pays 80% of the rest of the hospital stay (80% of $5,000 is $4,000). Then you pay the last $1,000. However, if in October you have to take your daughter to the doctor because she&#39;s gotten a Lego irretrievably lodged up her nose, you don&#39;t have to pay any of the deductible; it&#39;s already been paid for this year. You just pay the amount that&#39;s left after the insurance company has covered its share. Come January, though, your deductible resets and you have to start paying again.</p>
               <p>While we&#39;re on the topic of you paying money, let&#39;s talk about the out-of-pocket limit. This is the maximum amount of money that you will have to pay in a given year for insurance out of your own pocket. For singletons, this amount is $2,500; for those on the two-party or family plans, that amount is $5,000. So what does that mean to you? Let&#39;s go back to our example in the previous paragraph. You paid $4,000 for your first hospital stay ($3,000 deductible + the 20% that the insurance didn&#39;t cover). Let&#39;s say that instead of the nose Lego fiasco that October, what actually happened was you were gored by an angry deer while you were out hunting and you need surgery to repair your perforated kidney, which is going to set you back $100,000. 20% of $100,000 is $20,000, which is definitely not ideal; you need that money to buy guns and Legos. But never fear! You&#39;ve got insurance. The difference between the $5,000 limit and the amount you&#39;ve already paid is $1,000. You pay that and the insurance provider will pay 100% of the rest—at least, of the allowed amount—and everyone&#39;s happy (except for probably the deer).</p>
               <p>There are some caveats, though; certain things don&#39;t count toward your out-of-pocket limit. These include premiums (the amount you pay for the privilege of having insurance), balance-billed charges (the amount you pay if you used a non-participating provider and they charged more than the allowed amount), healthcare this plan doesn&#39;t cover, and penalties for failure to obtain pre-authorization for services.</p>
               <p>There&#39;s also good news, though: the HSA that all Wavetronix employees are on is designed to cover this amount—that is, if things work out as planned, you should have enough money in your HSA to cover these out-of-pocket expenses. This only works if your HSA is fully funded; if you&#39;re new and haven&#39;t put away much money yet, or if you&#39;ve had to use your HSA for dental work, for example, this won&#39;t work as well. Still, that is nothing to turn your nose up at.</p>
               <p>(If you have medical expenses and your HSA is not yet fully funded, health care providers are often amenable to letting you work out a payment plan for your medical expenses. In that case, you could pay the bill off in increments every time money gets put into your HSA.)</p>
               <h3>Coverage</h3>
               <p>
               </p>
               <p>As we get into the coverage section, let&#39;s cover a few points to be aware of: first, if you are on the family plan, the coverage listed below covers your dependents until they turn 26. Second, there is no pre-existing condition limitation. This means that if you&#39;ve already been diagnosed with Macgregor&#39;s Syndrome and you&#39;re going to need a lot of medical expenses paid, the insurance provider can&#39;t refuse to cover you because of it.</p>
               <p>Now the big question: what is covered and for how much? That info is all in that table we saw earlier, but here&#39;s a breakdown of that info with some explanations. Most of the amounts given are AD (after deductible). Remember our deductibles? $1,500 for single plans and $3,000 for family and two-party plans? Well, until you&#39;ve reached that deductible, you cover 100% of everything in the list below. Once you&#39;ve paid that $1,500 or $3,000 out of your own pocket, the following coverages kick in:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>For office visits, annual wellness exams, well child office visits, pap and lab tests, mammography, and prostate screening, you pay $15 AD.</li>
                  <li>Minor outpatient services are 100% covered.</li>
                  <li>For urgent care you pay $35 AD, while for emergency room visits you pay $75 AD.</li>
                  <li>For prescriptions, you pay 20% AD.</li>
                  <li>You pay 20% AD for the following: surgery, inpatient lab, X-rays, hospital outpatient services, major outpatient lab tests and X-rays, durable medical equipment (this is equipment and supplies ordered by a care provider, such as wheelchairs, oxygen equipment, etc.), and maternity (pre- and postnatal).</li>
                  <li>For rehabilitation services, you pay $15 AD, but they&#39;re only covered for up to 40 visits per year.</li>
                  <li>For mental health office visits and outpatient care, you pay $15 AD; for inpatient, you pay 20% AD.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Remember that all the numbers given above are only true if you&#39;re going to an in-network provider. Out-of-network providers are generally not covered as much.</p>
               <p>Be aware that all inpatient services must be reviewed and approved by the insurance provider; if you don&#39;t, you could be penalized $250.</p>
