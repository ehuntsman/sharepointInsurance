               <h2>Dental insurance at Wavetronix</h2>
               <hr/>
               <p>Wavetronix provides dental insurance to active full-time employees through MetLife Dental&#39;s PDP Plus Network. You are eligible for this insurance on the first of the month after the first full month of employment. So if you started on June 15, you&#39;d be eligible on August 1.</p>
               <p>To have this insurance, you need to opt in during open enrollment, which happens toward the end of each calendar year. Additionally, you can make changes to your insurance at the time of a major life event, such as marriage or the birth of a child.</p>
               <p>Remember that everyone at Wavetronix has an HSA, and you can use money from that HSA to pay your out-of-pocket expenses.</p>
               <div class="spacer">&#160;</div>
               <h2>Premiums</h2>
               <hr/>
               <p>The cost of this insurance to you (called a premium) is automatically taken out of your paycheck every pay period. The rest of the cost of the insurance is covered by Wavetronix. The premium you pay varies based on the plan you have elected:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>$3.39 for single plans. This plan is most commonly chosen by unmarried employees with no dependents. You could also elect to use it if you&#39;re married but your spouse is already covered by his or her company&#39;s insurance.</li>
                  <li>$7.13 for two-party plans. You might elect to use this plan if you are married with no dependents and you want your spouse covered by your insurance. You might also choose this plan if you have one dependent and no spouse (or your spouse doesn&#39;t need to be covered).</li>
                  <li>$13.09 for family plans. Choose this plan if you need to have two or more people (spouse and/or dependents) covered, in addition to yourself.</li>
               </ul>
               <div class="spacer">&#160;</div>
               <h2>Provider Network</h2>
               <hr/>
               <p>The amount that the insurance provider will cover varies based on which dental care provider you visit.</p>
               <p>The insurance provider has agreements with certain dental care providers; they have negotiated certain rates for certain services. These dental care providers are referred to as &quot;in-network.&quot; To get the insurance provider to cover as much of your costs as possible, it&#39;s wise to choose in-network providers. You can find in-network dental care providers in your area by visiting 
                  <a href="file:///C:/Users/enelson/Desktop/benefits/metlocator.metlife.com/metlocator/execute/Search">metlocator.metlife.com/metlocator/execute/Search</a> (make sure to select PDP Plus as your network type).</p>
               <p>But what if you can&#39;t find an in-network dental care provider you like, or you have a dental emergency while traveling? In this case, you can go to an out-of-network provider. Be aware that in order for you to receive the same coverage as with an in-network provider, the out-of-network provider must be determined, by the insurance provider, to charge &quot;reasonable and customary&quot; fees. This means that if the dental care provider charges more for procedures than what the insurance provider deems reasonable and customary in your area, you will be charged at least part of the difference. If you stick with in-network providers as much as possible, you&#39;ll never have that problem.</p>
               <div class="spacer">&#160;</div>
               <h2>Coverage</h2>
               <hr/>
               <p>The coverage numbers in the table on the previous page let you know how much of the costs you will be required to pay.</p>
               <p>Preventive care is covered 100% (both for in-network and for customary and reasonable out-of-network providers), twice a year. What this means is that when you or anyone else on your plan goes in for your six-month checkup, the insurance provider covers the entire cost. This includes the following:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Oral exam</li>
                  <li>Cleaning</li>
                  <li>X-rays (only once per year)</li>
                  <li>Fluoride treatment for children age 14 and under</li>
               </ul>
               <p>You pay 90% for basic services (also called minor restorative services), both for in-network and for customary and reasonable out-of-network providers, after deductible. A deductible is the amount of money you have to pay out of your own pocket (or your HSA) before the insurance kicks in. At Wavetronix, the deductible for a single plan is $50 and the deductible for a family or two-party plan is $150. However, this deductible only has to be paid once a year. This means that if you&#39;re on the single plan, and in February the dentist does a cavity filling that costs $200, you must pay $50 before the insurance will kick in. Then, they pay 10% of what&#39;s left—10% of $150 is $15—and you pay the final $135. (Usually you&#39;ll get sent a bill for that later.) However, if you then need a bacterial study in April, you don&#39;t have to worry about the $50, as it&#39;s already been paid for this year; you just pay your 90%. If you need another cavity filled next January, though, you&#39;re going to have to pay the deductible. Or you could just start flossing. Basic services include the following:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Fillings</li>
                  <li>Bacterial studies</li>
                  <li>Genetic tests for susceptibility to oral disease</li>
               </ul>
               <p>You pay 50% for major services (sometimes called major restorative services), both for in-network and for customary and reasonable out-of-network providers, after deductible. Major restorative services include the following:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Inlays/onlays</li>
                  <li>Crowns</li>
                  <li>Root canals</li>
                  <li>Dentures</li>
                  <li>Oral surgery</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Our insurance provider has set an annual maximum benefit of $1500 per person. This means that in one calendar year, the most they will pay out for each person is $1500; after that you&#39;re on your own. &quot;Each person&quot; means each person on the plan; if you&#39;ve got a husband on the plan, the provider could end up spending $3000 on you guys this year. If you&#39;ve got a husband and eight children, the insurance provider is probably hoping very strongly that you don&#39;t reach the maximum for all of them.</p>
               <p>Orthodontia is a slightly different beast. Orthodontic work is covered 50% (both for in-network and for customary and reasonable out-of-network providers), after deductible, but only for children under the age of 19. Also, instead of an annual maximum benefit, there is a lifetime maximum benefit of $1500 per person. That means that for orthodontia, they will pay out only $1500 per person, ever. Once you&#39;ve used up that $1500, it doesn&#39;t reset the next year.</p>
