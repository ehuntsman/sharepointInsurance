<div id="step3">​ 
   <p>A health savings account, or HSA, is a tax-advantaged account that you can use to pay for medical expenses (health, dental and vision). Like 401Ks and IRAs, they are defined and regulated by the IRS, but administered by financial institutions.</p>
   <p>So what makes an HSA better than paying for medical expenses out of your checking account? A few major things, as it turns out:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>The biggest is that tax-advantaged idea that we mentioned above. As with a traditional 401K, you can put money into an HSA pre-taxes—that is, if you make $50,000 in a year but put $5,000 in a year into an HSA, you only pay taxes on $45,000 that year. But better than a traditional 401K, if you use HSA money for qualified medical expenses (and most medical expenses count as qualified), you don&#39;t pay taxes on it when you take it out of the account, either. You heard that right. The money that you put into an HSA and use on medical expenses, you don&#39;t ever pay any income taxes on: not when you save it, not when you spend it. And to top it all off, the money in your account grows tax-free as well. Bam. Tax advantages all over the place.</li>
      <li>Speaking of money growing, you can invest the money in your HSA, which is better than it just sitting in your checking account.</li>
      <li>Once you turn 65, you can basically start treating your HSA like a 401K; you can continue to use it for medical expenses tax-free, but you can also use it for train tickets or postage stamps or Twin Peaks DVDs. In this case, you just have to pay the income tax on the money you withdraw, same as a traditional 401K.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>To be eligible to have an HSA, you must fit two criteria. First, you must have a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). Second, you can&#39;t have certain other kinds of health accounts, such as most FSAs, and you must not be covered under anyone else&#39;s health plan—your spouse or dependents may have such insurance, you personally just can&#39;t be covered under it.</p>
   <p>(An HDHP is a health plan with high deductibles but low premiums. In case you haven&#39;t read the health insurance section yet, here are some definitions:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Deductible – A set amount of money you must pay out of pocket for medical expenses before your insurance kicks in.</li>
      <li>Premium – What you pay to have insurance; a set amount that must be regularly paid.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>HDHPs can seem scary because you have to pay more out of your pocket for medical expenses. But since you pay less for premiums, that helps offset that cost. And if you don&#39;t need to go to the doctor much, they&#39;re an awesome idea.</p>
   <div class="spacer">&#160;</div>
   <h2>HSAs at Wavetronix</h2>
   <hr/>​ 
   <p>At Wavetronix, HSAs are administered through Health Equity. Now, HSAs don&#39;t have to be associated with your workplace, though they often are. You can stroll right up to the financial institution of your choice and open one all by your lonesome (provided the financial institution of your choice offers HSAs). But getting one through your workplace can have certain advantages, and that is definitely the case here.</p>
   <p>Every employee who has health insurance at Wavetronix also has an HSA. (FYI, for benefited employees, health insurance coverage starts on the first day of the month after you&#39;ve worked here for at least 30 days—so if you started here on June 15, your health insurance coverage would start on August 1.) Since we have an HDHP, you don&#39;t have to worry about whether you&#39;re eligible (unless you&#39;re covered by a spouse&#39;s non-HDHP insurance, in which case you do have to worry).</p>
   <p>With your usual workplace health insurance setups, you have traditional insurance—not HDHPs—and no HSA. You pay a higher premium every paycheck, but your deductible is lower. This feels like a safe sort of plan if you expect a lot of medical expenses.</p>
   <p>But Wavetronix does something different: here we have an HDHP and HSAs that are set up to work in tandem. Now, if you&#39;ve read the health insurance section of this website, and you should have because it&#39;s a great piece of writing, you may remember that the out-of-pocket limit for a single plan is $2,500 and for a two-party or family plan is $5,000. That is, the most that you could possibly be asked to pay for health expenses (not including dental) in a given year, between deductibles and co-insurance and co-pays, is $2,500 or $5,000; once you hit that number, the insurance will cover pretty much 100% of the rest. That&#39;s great, but you&#39;ve still got to come up with a few grand every year for that out-of-pocket expense.</p>
   <p>And that&#39;s where the HSA comes in. HDHPs, as we mentioned, tend to have lower premiums. So Wavetronix takes the money they saved by paying less for your premium (you and the company each pay part of your insurance premiums, in case you weren&#39;t aware) and they put it into an HSA for you instead. And the amount they put in is $2,500 or $5,000, depending on the plan you&#39;re on. Do those numbers sound familiar? They should; you read them in the last paragraph. The amount of money that Wavetronix contributes to your HSA should exactly cover your out-of-pocket expenses for the year. So, theoretically, even if you need a new lung or something similarly pricey, that expense should be entirely covered by the combination of your health insurance and the money Wavetronix puts in your HSA. You shouldn&#39;t pay anything out of pocket at all—just the premiums for the health insurance. Pretty great, right?</p>
   <div class="spacer">&#160;</div>
   <h2>Advantages</h2>
   <hr/>
   <p>So no matter what kind of health insurance user you are, this is good news. If you&#39;ve got six young children, and these young children are constantly picking up germs from the other kids in their taekwondo class and are constantly in a state of delusional confidence that taking a bike off this homemade ramp is an excellent idea and will definitely not result in any broken bones, you are basically entirely covered for their medical expenses. You might end up draining your HSA every year, but that is A-OK; that&#39;s what it&#39;s for. And you&#39;re not paying a bunch of out-of-pocket expenses, so it&#39;s significantly cheaper than being on a traditional health insurance plan.</p>
   <p>But now suppose that your kids are well-behaved high school-aged students who prefer orchestra over football so they never break any bones and they&#39;ve already had all their shots and none of them have been sick enough to need a doctor since The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody went off the air. You guys might not have many medical expenses at all, in which case, bonus round for you because you suddenly have a lot more money than you might have had otherwise.</p>
   <p>See, insurance is a gamble: if you end up needing it, it was worth all the money you paid. But if you never need to use it, all that money you pay is just disappearing into the mist (and by &quot;the mist&quot; we mean &quot;the insurance company&#39;s coffers&quot;). But in this case, you/Wavetronix are paying less money to the insurance company and more into your HSA. And if you don&#39;t use all the money in your HSA, that just keeps being your money. Unlike FSAs and certain other health expense accounts, where you must use all the money in the account by the end of the year or lose it, HSA money rolls over into next year. So all the HSA money you didn&#39;t spend last year will stay in your account and this year&#39;s money will be added on top of that. And if you continue to not spend that money, the balance is just going to keep getting bigger. It&#39;s as though the insurance you didn&#39;t end up using is just turning into HSA money. (But that&#39;s not actually what&#39;s happening; it&#39;s just meant to be a nice illustration. Don&#39;t tell an actual financial person I said that.)</p>
   <p>So what should you do with that money? Save it, if you can. Invest it. You can invest through Health Equity by visiting healthequity.com; be aware that you can&#39;t invest unless you have $2,000 in your account and then you can only invest whatever amount exceeds that $2,000. And then, when you need to, use it for qualified medical expenses.</p>
   <p>And if you leave Wavetronix, the account goes with you—although if you no longer have an HDHP, you keep the HSA but you can&#39;t contribute anymore until you&#39;re on an HDHP again.</p>
   <div class="spacer">&#160;</div>
   <h2>Contributions</h2>
   <hr/>
   <p>As we mentioned above, Wavetronix will contribute $2,500 or $5,000 to your HSA yearly. However, you&#39;re allowed to contribute more than that, if you want. The IRS-mandated contribution limits in 2014 are as follows:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>For single plans, $3,300; if you&#39;re over 55, $4,300</li>
      <li>For two-party or family plans, $6,550; if you&#39;re over 55, $7,550</li>
   </ul>
   <p>So if you&#39;ve realized that you love all the great tax advantages of the HSA, you could contribute extra money and reach your contribution maximum. If you want to do this, talk to HR and they can set it up so that extra is automatically taken from your paycheck and added to your HSA. You can change your contribution amount at any time; you don&#39;t have to wait for the new year or anything.</p>
   <div class="spacer">&#160;</div>
   <h2>Using Money from your HSA</h2>
   <hr/>
   <p>The usual reason to use money from your HSA is to pay for medical expenses. There are two ways to do this:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Soon after starting your HSA, you should receive a debit card in the mail from Health Equity. You can use this like any debit card, except that you can only use it at doctors&#39; offices, pharmacies, etc.</li>
      <li>You can pay the expense out of your own pocket, and then reimburse yourself later from your HSA. This requires a little more doing than swiping a card, but it&#39;s good to know that if you forget to use your card, you can still get the tax advantages of the HSA. If you do this, just remember to keep any receipts related to the transaction, so that if you&#39;re ever audited you can prove that it was a medical expense you reimbursed yourself for and this wasn&#39;t your sneaky way to get your HSA to pay for an Xbox.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Or, like we mentioned, once you reach 65 you can treat your HSA like a 401K and use it for regular expenses. In this case, you do have to pay income tax on the money you withdraw, but hey, you just saved and invested that money for forty years so that&#39;s still a win.</p>
   <p>The one snag in this whole plan is that you&#39;ll have enough money in your HSA to cover your out-of-pocket expenses—but not until the end of your first year here, since the money is added incrementally with every paycheck. Fortunately, there&#39;s an easy fix for this: most health care providers are very happy to set up a payment plan for you. Just let them know that you&#39;re on an HSA and that you will have the money in the future, and generally they&#39;ll be fine with letting you pay in increments as money is added to your HSA.</p>
   <div class="spacer">&#160;</div>
   <h2>Limited-purpose Flex</h2>
   <hr/>
   <p>This isn&#39;t exactly the same as your HSA, but it&#39;s important to mention and there was nowhere else that it fit. As we mentioned earlier, you can&#39;t get an HSA if you&#39;ve got certain other health spending accounts, such as an FSA (flexible spending account). However, you are allowed in have both an HSA and a limited-purpose flexible spending account. And lucky you—Wavetronix just happens to offer just such an account.</p>
   <p>So what&#39;s an FSA? This is an account into which you can put money that you will use on health or child care expenses. The advantage to doing this is, like so many things we&#39;ve talked about, tax-related. Specifically, you put money into the account pre-taxes, and then you spend it pre-taxes. Yes, like the HSA, as long as you use it on medical expenses you will never pay any taxes on that money.</p>
   <p>There are some caveats, though, that make it a little more complicated. With an FSA, you must elect at the beginning of the year how much you&#39;re going to put in, and once you have done that, you can&#39;t add any more. Also complicating matters is the fact that the money doesn&#39;t roll over to the new year; if you have money in the account at the year&#39;s end, you will lose it. So this can make deciding how much money to put in quite complicated. If you put in too little money, you&#39;ll run out of money and you won&#39;t get as much of that tax-advantaged goodness. If you put in too much money, you&#39;ll reach Christmas and realize that if you don&#39;t spend that $400 by next week, you&#39;ll lose it, so you&#39;ll end up buying a whole pile of prescription sunglasses just for the sake of buying something. So you have to approach the question of how much to contribute quite carefully.</p>
   <p>At Wavetronix, the FSA offered isn&#39;t simply an FSA, it&#39;s a limited-purpose FSA (because, as we said, you couldn&#39;t have an HSA otherwise). The &quot;limited-purpose&quot; bit refers to the fact that you can only use this FSA for vision or dental expenses, not for health expenses. You can contribute up to $2,550 per year to this plan, and the money is available to use immediately. If you see yourself having some major dental work done in the coming year, this could be a good way to set some money aside for it that you won&#39;t have to pay taxes on. If that&#39;s something you&#39;re interested in, opt in during the next bout of open enrollment (toward the end of each year).​&#160;</p> ​
